#+TITLE: Bach Motif Analysis

** Finding BACH with Python

1. Introduce computational musicology

    - How, when and why would one apply programming to musicology?

2. Introduce the Bach motif

3. Discuss data formats used in computational musicology
   - Focus on MusicXML

4. Accessing musical corpora
   - What are the options for finding and loading a musical corpus?

5. Discuss important music21 objects

6. Provide foundational skills for finding the motif
   - Iterating over scores
   - Finding groups of note objects we are interested in

7. Give an example that finds the motif in simplistic cases

   Find the motif, but fail in some edge cases such as:
   - fails if the motif occurs across bar lines
   - can't find the motif across different voices

8. Identify motifs successfully in a more complex situation
   - i.e. across measures and/or voices

9. Examine the musical contexts of motif occurrences
   - Tonal qualities
   - Where the motif occurs in relation to the whole

10. Tie a pipeline together and run on a non-Bach corpus

11. Draw and analyze results on musical staff
    - Show how to display results on a staff by highlighting the notes we identified in the analysis.

12. Listen to the results

    Write a function that will allow students to listen to and compare each occurrence of the motif in the context of each piece by generating midi for each one.
